Description: filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol
 sshfs is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
 Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
 to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the
 client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
 server with ssh.
 .
 sshfs is FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace).
