Description: pager program similar to more
 This package provides "less", a file pager (that is, a memory-efficient
 utility for displaying text one screenful at a time). Less has many
 more features than the basic pager "more". As part of the GNU project,
 it is widely regarded as the standard pager on UNIX-derived systems.
 .
 Also provided are "lessecho", a simple utility for ensuring arguments
 with spaces are correctly quoted; "lesskey", a tool for modifying the
 standard (vi-like) keybindings; and "lesspipe", a filter for specific
 types of input, such as .doc or .txt.gz files.
